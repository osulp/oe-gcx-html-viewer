            <b>Welcome to the Oregon Aquaculture Financial Planning Tool!</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            This tool is designed to help you learn about aquaculture systems and the financial considerations involved in setting up an operation. 
        </p>
        <p>
             To navigate around the tool, use the left navigation tabs to step through the various components of an aquaculture system.  You can jump directly to the <b>Summary</b> page and see the full range of calculated values based on the defaults or your selections for selected inputs like feed cost, labor rates, etc.
        </p>
        <p>If you would like to explore the backend model and modify the base assumptions, you can download the model spreadsheet with generic default values.  Note, it will not include your selections in this tool.  You can print out our tool selections and then use those in the downloaed spreadsheet for further exploring.</p>
