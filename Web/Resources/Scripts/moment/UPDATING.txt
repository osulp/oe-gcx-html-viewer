About
=====
The version of Moment that we are using is the one bundled with Esri's JavaScript API. We host local
copies of Esir's locale files for use with GMAF. The moment-timezone-with-data.js file does NOT
come from Esri -- this needs to be updated directly from moment.js.

Updating
========
If you update the locales files, you will need to re-run the small script that generates the 
locale/all-locales.js file as detailed below.

Prerequisites
=============
You need to have the following installed:
- nodejs for npm (https://nodejs.org/).
- grunt command line tool (run “npm install -g grunt-cli”)

Building
========
1. Open a command prompt and change to the directory containing this file.
2. Run "npm install" to fetch all of the packages needed for the build.
3. Run "grunt" to build. If it completes successfully, it will create/update locale/all-locales.js.
